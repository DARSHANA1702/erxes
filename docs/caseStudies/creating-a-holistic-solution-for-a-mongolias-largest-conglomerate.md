### About Tavan Bogd Group

The Tavan Bogd Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in Mongolia. It has 16 subsidiaries, 3 affiliate companies, and 4 business units, employing over 12,000 workers. As the largest employer in Mongolia, it contributes billions of tugriks in tax to the Government. Its subsidiaries and affiliate companies are successful ventures in their respective fields. They are consistently listed in the annual “Top-100” businesses by the Mongolian Government and the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI).

**Industry:** Investment Management | Multi-industry

**Company size:** 10,001+ employees

**Location:** Mongolia

**Software:** Sales, Marketing

### The Challenge

The fundamental challenge for Tavan Bogd Group was each of their companies operating separately. This meant separate customer databases, toolsets and social media accounts. They could not leverage any economies of scale and joint efforts. It needed a central system to manage these complex databases and account details.

None of the tools used by the subsidiaries were particularly effective. It led to a culture where customers weren’t at the heart of the firm’s initiatives.

### Choosing erxes

Tavan Bogd were particularly interested in many features available through erxes. Self-hosted deployment would ensure security and privacy. The IYT team would be able to have access to the source code, servers’ APIs and libraries. Most importantly, it would provide a centralized solution.

The firm would adopt a customer centric approach and support synergies by managing over 20 websites, 100 social accounts and 500 forms from one place.

Outside of SaaS platforms, there are no other options in the market as comprehensive or flexible as erxes. There are also no other on-premises solutions like erxes.

> _“The main driver was an all-in-one platform with ease of use and quick onboarding. Really, we see no competitors. There’s been no turning back.”_

### Delivering the Project

We worked with Tavan Bogd to connect the CRM activities of 100 individual businesses. We created a single location where 20 of them had access to information from across the group.

Inevitably, some subsidiaries are not able to exchange information. In those cases, these companies can see their own data, but it protects data belonging to other subsidiaries.

Once we installed the system, we provided training and customized it for each of the companies within the group.

### The Results

For Tavan Bogd the most important features were the all-in-one tool for customer support, sales and marketing. The ease of deployment and simple onboarding impressed them. It also ensured staff could use the full capabilities of the platform.

Everyone in the business has benefitted from more accurate data. Now it syncs across many businesses and the firm can manage and budget for other tools they use.

There have also been significant productivity improvements and revenue gains. Now their companies can operate from a centralized sales, marketing and customer support facility.
