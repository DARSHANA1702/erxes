Elevating the customer journey by effectively managing data, customer support, marketing, and sales team with a single tool – erxes.

<!--truncate-->

### About Skytel

Established in 1999, Skytel has brought many tech innovations to the mobile network in Mongolia. It is one of the nation's leading mobile phone operators. The business strives to ensure that Mongolia keeps up with global trends. For that reason, it commits to delivering a range of products that meet the needs of their customers.

**Industry:** Telecomunications

**Company size:** 1,001-5,000 employees

**Location:** Ulaanbaatar

**Software:** Sales, Marketing

### The Challenge

With hundreds of thousands of customers across the country rely on a safe and secure mobile network. Keeping customer data safe is a major priority for Skytel. The telecommunications sector is heavily regulated in Mongolia. As a result, Skytel can not use customer relationship management SaaS platforms like other businesses.

A particular challenge with continuous innovation in tech is the number of different tools you need to keep the business running. To enable the technological developments of the last two decades, you need several tools. But often, effectively sharing customer data between them is tricky.

This created many databases with data inaccuracies. Also, sharing information and managing these tools caused a complex integration process. The senior team at Skytel were keen to become more customer-centric.

### Choosing erxes

To become more customer-focused, any solution needed to be able to control customer data and follow regulations. At much lower cost, erxes could offer the same benefits as any proprietary solution would. Self-hosted deployment on the firm’s premises offered the level of reassurance Skytel was looking for. The client would also have full access to source code, server APIs and libraries.

### Delivering the Project

We worked with Tavan Bogd to connect the CRM activities of 100 individual businesses. We created a single location where 20 of them had access to information from across the group.

Inevitably, some subsidiaries are not able to exchange information. In those cases, these companies can see their own data, but it protects data belonging to other subsidiaries.

Once we installed the system, we provided training and customized it for each of the companies within the group.

### The Results

The organization managed their customer support, marketing, and sales team with a single tool. Combined with improved data management, this elevated the customer journey significantly. Skytel was particularly impressed with the ease of installation and adoption:
